Kohanax AI
Kohanax AI is the first AI-powered mining agent designed specifically for optimizing the performance of cryptocurrency mining machines. It combines machine learning algorithms with real-time mining data to enhance mining efficiency, minimize power consumption, and increase overall hash rates. This project offers an intelligent solution for mining operators, enabling them to maximize profitability and reduce operational costs.

Features
Real-Time Data Stream: Collects real-time mining data such as temperature, power consumption, and hash rate using WebSockets.
AI-Driven Optimization: Utilizes machine learning models to optimize mining parameters based on historical and real-time data.
Fault Detection & Recovery: Automatically detects faults in mining equipment and attempts to recover the system.
Dynamic Market Analysis: Adjusts mining parameters based on cryptocurrency price changes and market conditions.
API Integration: Provides secure RESTful APIs with basic authentication for external integration.
Task Scheduler: Automates regular mining optimization tasks using the schedule library.
Logging & Monitoring: Tracks and logs mining operations for transparency and troubleshooting.

Installation
To get started with Kohanax AI, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pip package manager
Flask
Flask-HTTPAuth
Requests
WebSockets
Schedule

Usage
Once you have set up Kohanax AI, you can start monitoring and optimizing your mining machines using the following functionalities:

Real-Time Monitoring
Connect to the WebSocket server to stream mining data (hash rate, temperature, power consumption).
Use the provided web dashboard to view real-time mining stats.
AI Optimization
The system will automatically adjust the mining parameters (frequency, power, etc.) to optimize performance based on the data collected.
Fault Detection and Recovery
The system continuously monitors your mining machines for faults and attempts automatic recovery if a failure is detected.
API Integration
POST /predict: Use this endpoint to get predictions for optimal mining parameters.
Requires basic authentication (username and password).

Task Scheduler
You can schedule regular optimization tasks to ensure your mining operation is always running at peak efficiency. The Kohanax AI agent will perform optimization automatically every 10 minutes.

Running Scheduled Tasks
The scheduled tasks can be run as part of your system's background process, ensuring regular mining optimizations without any manual intervention.
